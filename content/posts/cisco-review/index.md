## Introduction

Cisco Systems, Inc. is an American multinational technology conglomerate headquartered in San Jose, California, in the center of Silicon Valley. Cisco develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and other high-technology services and products.

Cisco every year hires a lot of Software engineers both on-campus as well as Off-campus across various colleges in India. But I have widely seen during the placement seasons that a lot of candidates have doubts regarding applying for cisco as most of them are aiming for a role related to software engineering and Cisco is widely known as a networking company. SO in this article I am gonna cover those things as well as CIsco interview Questions, their CTC as well as how good is the work as well as work culture.

## Interview Format and Questions

The journey of Cisco interviews starts with a normal online round as same as most of the other IT companies do.

#### Online Round

The online Round consists of 10- 15 aptitude questions. These aptitude questions can contain electronics questions as well as what I have come to know from candidates. So if you are a CS student and don't know the answers to those questions I feel it's fine as most of the other students won't know the answers as well. So you should focus more on the 2 coding questions which will be there as well apart from the aptitude questions.
Coding questions also carry a lot of weightage and if you don't know answers to a lot of aptitude questions then coding questions might help to save your ass and provide an interview chance from an online round.

#### Interview Rounds

So interview rounds generally consist of 4-5 rounds of which the last round is generally the HR round. I asked a lot of Cisco employees regarding their interview experiences and what I have come to know is that interviews are dependent on you and your resume. Where electronic candidates were asked quite a bit of networking questions, on the other hand, IT/CS students were not asked as many. IT/CS students had more coding questions and even this is not a hard and fast rule. One employee also told me that he was from an ECE background but still he told an interviewer that he knew CS subjects and coding questions better so he wasn't asked a lot of ECE-related questions. A lot of this also depends upon your resume and the type of projects you have mentioned in it. Below is a detailed round by round experience of one of the candidates from the Electronics branch.

##### Round 1

1. Difference between semaphores and mutex. Give real-life examples.
2. Give a real-life example of deadlock.
3. Give various approaches for string reversals and finding palindromes in strings (4-5)
4. Explain how u did this project from your resume. Why didn't u win that hackathon? (The project was done in a Hackathon).
5. Basic linked list coding questions were asked as well.

##### Round 2

1. There was an illogical OS question, <br/>
